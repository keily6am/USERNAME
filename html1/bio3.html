    <h2>Brief Biography:</h2>
    <p>A little bit about me is that I love to sleep and stay in bed.</p>
    <p>Honestly, that would be my career choice if it were one.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a senior attending AHS. Although it's fall, college season is upon us.</p>
    <p>I spend most of my days procrastinating, watching Gossip Girl or Friends, but other days I'll occasionally open my laptop.</p>
    <p>I'm the youngest of four, and although with all the perks, I never felt like the favorite.</p>
    <p>I'm not your ideal first-gen, straight A student, and that's mostly because no one in my family has ever done it.</p>
    <p>I'm probably your average C student, who spends more time enjoying her life with those around her than staying up at 3am doing homework.</p>
    <p>Some fun things about me is that I absolutely can't function without music playing in my ears. I mostly listen to rock, </p>
    <p>alternative, salsa, rap, metal, and other. As you can observe, my music taste is everywhere, and that's because </p>
    <p>it depends on my mood or mainly whatever sounds good to me. </p>
